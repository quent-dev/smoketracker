# Smoke Tracker

## Implementation plan

Data Structure:
1. Core data model to track:
   - Timestamp of each cigarette
   - Daily count
   - Notes/triggers (optional)
   - Quit attempts/streaks
   - Target goals

Basic Components:
1. Data Storage System
   - SQLite database (lightweight, perfect for mobile)
   - Key tables: Cigarettes, DailyStats, QuitAttempts, Goals

2. Core Functions
   - Record new cigarette
   - Get time since last cigarette
   - Calculate daily/weekly/monthly statistics
   - Track streak data (longest time without smoking)
   - Set and monitor goals

3. Analysis Features
   - Pattern recognition (time of day, day of week)
   - Progress tracking
   - Money saved calculations
   - Health milestone tracking

Implementation Phases:

Phase 1 - Core Backend
1. Set up database structure
2. Implement basic recording functions
3. Create data retrieval methods
4. Build basic statistics calculations

Phase 2 - Analysis Layer
1. Implement advanced statistics
2. Add pattern recognition
3. Create reporting functions
4. Develop milestone tracking

Phase 3 - API Layer
1. Create REST API endpoints
2. Implement authentication
3. Set up data validation
4. Create mobile-friendly endpoints

Phase 4 - Mobile UI (Future)
1. Design mobile interface
2. Implement front-end
3. Connect to backend API
4. Add notifications

Would you like to start with implementing any specific component? We could begin with either:
1. Setting up the database structure
2. Creating the core recording functions
3. Building the basic statistics calculations
